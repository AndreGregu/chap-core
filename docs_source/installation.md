# Installation and Getting Started

## Requirements

The `chap-core` Python package requires Python 3.10 or higher and is tested to work on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 

Most of the built-in forecasting models in CHAP require Docker to run, and we recommend also using Docker to set up 
`chap-core` for most use cases (see below). The current built-in models are not resource-intensive, and one should be 
fine with 4 GB of RAM.

## Installation Options

Installation of CHAP depends on how you want to use it. Here we present several possible ways to install CHAP:

- [Setting up CHAP Core CLI tool](./installation/chap-core-setup.rst)
- [Setting up CHAP REST-API locally with Docker](./installation/docker-compose-doc.md)
- [Setting up CHAP REST-API on a server](./installation/running-chap-on-server.md)
- [Setting up CHAP Prediction App in DHIS2](./installation/prediction-app-setup.md)
