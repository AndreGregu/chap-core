Installation and getting started
===================================

Installation of chap-core
---------------------------

Installation of CHAP depends on how you want to use CHAP. If you are developing custom models or integrating external forecasting models with CHAP, you should install the chap-core Python package:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install chap-core

Local or sever setup with docker
----------------------------------

If you want to run models that are already available with CHAP locally on a computer or on a server, we recommend setting up CHAP using docker. `See this guide for setting up CHAP using Docker Compose <docker-compose-doc>`_.

Development setup
------------------

If you want to contribute to the chap-core Python codebase, you will need to set up a development environment. The following is our recommended setup. You will need to have Python 3.10 or a higher version installed.
