Developing custom models with CHAP
==================================

CHAP is designed to allow model developers to easily develop their own models outside CHAP and use CHAP to benchmark/evaluate their models, or to import and use utility functions from CHAP in their own models.

We here provide guides for implementing custom models in *Python* and *R*. The recommended flow is slightly different for the two different languages, but the general idea is the same.


Developing custom models in Python
----------------------------------

Code base structure
....................

We recommend that you develop your model through a custom Python project and not inside the CHAP codebase. Your Python code should have command line entry points for *training* the model and *predicting* based on a trained model. This could e.g. simply be two Python files that are run with some command line arguments or a command line interface (e.g. built with something like argparse or typer).

Your code base should as a minimum have:

- An entry point for training the model (e.g. a file called train.py)
- An entry point for predicting based on a trained model (e.g. a file called predict.py)
- An MLProject configuration file for your model that specifies the entry points (se the section about integration with CHAP below)

An easy way to get started is to clone our example barebone repository for a Python model, which can be found `here <https://github.com/dhis2-chap/minimalist_example>`_. This will give you a train.py and predict.py file that you can use as starting points, as well with an MLProject configuration file.

Step 1: Test/develop your model outside CHAP
.............................................

The following is a suggested workflow that can be used when developing and testing your model. For ease of development, we recommend a workflow where you can run your model without fully integrating it with CHAP first. This makes it easier to debug and test your model in isolation. You should still make sure your model handles the data formats that CHAP uses. The easiest way is to test directly on example data provided by CHAP.


Step 2: Running your model through CHAP
.........................................

The final step is to use CHAP to evaluate your model. The benefit of running your model through CHAP is that you can let CHAP handle all the data processing and evaluation, and you can easily compare your model to other models. To do this, you need to create an MLProject configuration file for your model. This file should specify the entry points for training and predicting, as well as any dependencies your model has. You can then run your model through CHAP using the CHAP CLI.
