## Integrating external models

CHAP can run external models in two ways:

- By specifying a path to a local code base
- or by specifying a github URL to a git repo. The url needs to start with https://github.com/

In either case, the directory or repo should contain a config.yaml file that specifies how to train and predict with the model.

The YAML file should follow this structure:

```yaml
name: [Name of the model]
train_command: [A template string for command that is run for training the model. Should contain {train_data} (which will be replaced with a train data file when .train() is called on the model) and {model} (whish will be replaced by a temp file name that the model is stored to).
predict_command: [A template command for training. Should contain {future_data} (which will be replaced by a .csv file containing future data) and {model}.
```

An example:
```yaml
name: hydromet_dengue
train_command: "Rscript train2.R {train_data} {model} map.graph"
predict_command: "Rscript predict.R {future_data} {model}"
```

### Using a docker image for external models

It is possible to add a docker image with the external model, which CHAP then will use when running the model.

To do this, add a `dockerfile` key to the config.yaml file:

```yaml
dockerfile: path/to/directory/with/dockerfile
```

The `dockerfile` keyword should point to a directory that contains a Dockerfile that specifies how to build the docker image. This path is relative to the directory of the model itself.
