- Set data-elements as config
- config yml for models, for which data-elements that are used
- Save report configuration, run with same configuration. 
- Admin panel.
- Multiple dataelements, stratified model
- Extend prediction from previous observations

# Suggestions for aims
- Get climate data directly to CHAP
- Streamlining process for running it in a country / running in one country + 1+1
- - Avoiding too much server communications 
- - Governaces processes
- - Laos example
- - Set up a virtual machine in a country
- - How resource driven are these models. Kubernetes or Docker
- Running it on real data from csv
- - External data sources
- Separating into data scientist app and user app + Daniela + 1
- Dynamically show models, require data elements + 1
- - Add other climate sources dynamically
- Integrate the WHO-Ewars model + GIO +1
- Integrarte local climate data, IRI map room, into DHIS2->CHAP + Pat + 1
- Evaluating whether a model works in CHAP, validation plots
- Automatic communication with existing frameworks -> Modularize CHAP, make it e 
- Low hanging design fruits
- Server2Server communication
- - Instance to instance
- Parametrization of the models
- Stan model + GIO
- Getting forecast into chap + 1
- Manually set parameters for districts
- Use GEE to get urbanization
- Identify other disease/climmate relationships
- Multiple countries or subnational
- Announcement in case of predicted outbrake
- Simple triangulation use case / visual analytics
- Calendar issues
- Running on local machine
